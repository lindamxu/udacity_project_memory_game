## Description

This is an interactive memory card game that tests a player on the number of moves and the total amount of time for him or her to correctly match 8 pairs of cards.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Installation

To render the game on a web browser, first clone or download this repository. Once the files are on your computer, run the
"index.html" on your web browser. Happy playing!
